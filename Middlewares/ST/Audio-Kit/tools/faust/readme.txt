There are two ways to create a Faust project through the Web interface using:
	- Faust IDE which can be accessed at https://faustide.grame.fr/ and to export the C file, select "export -> source -> C".
	- Using Faust command line interface and the DSP file. Download Faust Cli from https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/releases.

The Faust converter is given as an example. It applies some patches on the C code generated by Faust to prevent build issues. 
However, there may be issues during the conversion due to bugs in the C generation such as:
    - Syntax incompatibility with the IAR or GCC toolchain that needs manual correction,
    - the converter has been tested with FAUST Version 2.70.3; later ones may come with incompatibilities
    - huge tables generated that don't fit MCU Memory and Flash specifications, or CPU load not compatible with the MCU specifications.
    - Faust generates a C file with missing headers C (Includes)
    - Faust generated code may consume CPU load not compatible with the MCU specifications. The user MUST ensure that the use case is compatible with the MCU performance.

As examples, all algorithms located at Audio-Kit\src\algos\faust have been converted directly from examples available on Faust IDE website. There are: 
    - phasing/phaser.dsp, 
    - phasing/flager.dsp, 
    - reverb/dattorro.dsp, 
    - dynamic/compressor.dsp, 
    - delayEcho/echo.dsp, 
    - and so on.

Note that the converter uses source code templates designed for filtering, which is the main use case. In this case there is only one input and one output pin.
Default templates are not suitable for Src elements (no input pin) or Sink elements (no output pin). 
Therefore, some adaptation must be done in capability descriptions to be perfectly adapted. 
For example, if a wave generator is designed and needs to play immediately without modifying the source code templates, the input must be connected to a dummy Src element to make the audio chain engine coherencies happy.
